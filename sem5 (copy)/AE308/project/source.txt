In this video we discuss how to use the root locus method to design a PID controller.  In addition to discussing the theory, we look at Matlab tools to enable this workflow.  In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting controller on a real system.  Finally, we discuss how this approach is generalizable to designing any linear controller.
